# Personal Combat Process

Our implementation of Personal Combat in Traveller follows a semplified version of *Cepheus Engine SRD* ruleset.

## Checklist

The combat is formed by these elements.

1. **Initiative**
    - The Referee choose the character that are awere of the opponent. The inititive roll of this character is considered `12`.
    - All remaning character roll 2D6 for the initiative roll
    - If a character has the Tactics Skill can make a Skill Check and add the resulting effect to the character's initiative of his unit.
    - To compute the initiative use initiative roll `+ DEX` (if present add the result of the Tactics Skill Check).
    - The order of action is determined by sorting in descending order. In case of tie the character with the grater `DEX` go first. If there are still tie the first is choosen randomly.
2. **Combact Round**
    - Each round is 6 seconds long.
    - The character can make one minor action and one significant action (optionally can make 2 minor action instead of the significant one).
